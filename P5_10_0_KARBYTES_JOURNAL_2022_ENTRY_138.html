<p>It was brought to my attention that <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocal_recognition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subvocal recognition technology</a> could be what is causing the police to be able to decode what my verbal thoughts are. Basically, subvocal recognition technology involves diodes which detect electrical activity from nerves in my throat which control my vocal chords and face muscles. Without having to access my brain activity directly, the subvocal recognition devices can detect what I am verbally thinking and not speaking out load because merely thinking about how to formulate words with my mouth sends electrical signals to my throat and mouth muscles. Such technology can fairly accurately predict which words I am thinking such that I can carry on a conversation with other people without speaking out loud. To reply to my internal dialogue, people can send signals to my cochlea such that only I hear the transmitted auditory message using <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microwave auditory effect</a>.</p>
