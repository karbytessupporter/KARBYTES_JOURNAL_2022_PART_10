<p>Things I intend to spend my money on which I earn from working at some kind of suitable on-site job are itemized in the following quasi table. Note the floating-point number component of each <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;JSON&#8221;</a> record (i.e. row in the &#8220;table&#8221;) represents the percentage of my paycheck to allocate to the respective category. Each of those percentages in the table should add up to exactly 1.</p>

<pre>CATEGORY_0 := { "Emergency &amp; Misculaneous Savings Fund" : 0.2 }. // to replace electronics, bicycles, shoes, outdoor gear, drugs, books, movies, et cetera

CATEGORY_1 := { "Food &amp; Household Supplies" : 0.4 }. // to purchase vegetables, grains, plant-based proteins, vitamin supplements, plant-based laundry detergents and soaps, et cetera

CATEGORY_2 := { "Post Office Box" : 0.2 }. // to rent a unit to have my packages, legal documents (e.g. W-2 form), and other small items sent to so that those packages do not get intercepted

CATEGORY_3 := { "Mobile Phone &amp; Mobile Internet" : 0.2 }. // to pay for my monthly AT&amp;T phone number to stay in service (at a rate of $30 per month) and to pay $20 per 3 gigabytes of mobile data
</pre>
<p>There is not category for renting a housing unit because I intend to keep camping in various locations which fit my schedule and preferences. CATEGORY_0 is meant to cover what little money I spend on <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gasoline</a> and maybe even motor oil. I do not intend to use the car enough to have to take it in for maintenance to have its tires rotated nor replaced. The car is really just a power tool to show that I have as much power as seemingly other people do (in the region of the world I live in). That does not mean that I must use the car. <span style="background:#00ff00;">Just keeping it in park and only driving it once a week to keep the engine from going stale seems to be all I have to do to keep that car &#8220;in service&#8221; for the next two years.</span> Within that time period, I hope to overcome being dependent on that car and to return it to my mom&#8217;s driveway because, by then, I will be an expert user of public transportation (e.g. <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BART</a>, taxis) and bicycling. I do not feel comfortable investing in a car (but if I did I would certainly only want to invest in an entirely electric vehicle which solely I own the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_(property)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">title</a> to). In fact, I intend to get a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bicycle</a> as soon as I can afford one so that I can mostly rely on that for my commute and just keep the car parked on that special side street for backup purposes and as a place to store my bicycle. Given that I intend to start work at 7:30AM and end work around 6PM, I think there will be plenty of time to bike to and from BART stations (between where I camp and where I work).</p>
<p>Note also that CATEGORY_0 is where any surplus money will end up. More than 20% of my paychecks will probably end up being used for that category.</p>
